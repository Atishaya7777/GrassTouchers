⮑ saying "your mom" as an insult

nope, can't do that, my mom said it's too hard.

"Your mom" with an eye roll emoji.

gg, just kidding with that move.

You think you're so cool, but your mom thinks you're still living under a rock.

F, yeah right, like your mom would do better.

LFG (Looking For Group) tonight!

N/A for sure.

You're playing like a noob.

Can't believe I'm still farming after hours.

GG (Good Game) every time!

Why did I leave this game again?

New player? Yeah, we've seen them before.

Need to go AFK (Away From Keyboard) for a bit.

MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) life, 24/7.

Ranked ladder is so toxic.

You're playing like your mom taught you how to game.

Can't believe someone still plays like this after years of gaming.

Your mom would be better at this.

Playing like your mom left you with no skills.

Why is everyone so bad these days? Your mom included.

You're not even close to your mom's level.

If your mom could game, she'd be embarrassed by your performance.

Your mom would have farmed this boss faster.

I've seen better aim from a toddler playing their first game.

No cap, just landed the biggest drop yet!

I've given up hope, I don't think things will ever get better.

It's just too hard, I don't think it's worth the effort.

I'm so tired of feeling like I'm not good enough.

The world is a cruel place, and it's only going to get worse.

I don't think you have what it takes to make it in this world.

You're just setting yourself up for disappointment if you think you can achieve that.

I've been disappointed so many times, I don't think I can take it anymore.

I'm starting to think that I'm just not cut out for this.

I'm so disappointed in the new policy, it's going to hurt a lot of people.

Nothing good ever comes out of this company, they always let us down.

I don't think I'll ever be able to achieve my goals, it's all too overwhelming.

The future looks bleak, I'm not sure how we'll survive this.

I've been trying for years, but I just can't seem to catch a break.

This is a terrible idea, it's going to end in disaster.

I'm not looking forward to tomorrow, it's just going to be another struggle.

I've lost all hope, I don't think things will ever get better.

The system is rigged against us, we don't stand a chance.

I'm so frustrated, I feel like I'm getting nowhere.

I don't think I can do this anymore, it's all too much.

This is a waste of time, we're never going to succeed.

I'm not sure how much more of this I can take, it's really getting to me.

I've tried everything, but nothing seems to work.

I'm starting to think that I'm just not good enough.

This is a lost cause, we should just give up now.

I'm so discouraged, I don't think I can keep going.

I've been knocked down so many times, I'm not sure how to get back up.

I don't think I'll ever be able to overcome this, it's too big.

I'm feeling really down, I just want to give up.

This is a nightmare, I just want to wake up.

I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up, it's exhausting.

I've had enough, I'm done trying.

I'm so disappointed in myself, I feel like a failure.

I don't think I'll ever be able to forgive myself for this.

I'm stuck in a rut, I don't know how to get out.

This is a never-ending cycle of disappointment and frustration.

I'm so tired of feeling like I'm not good enough.

I've tried to be positive, but it's just not working.

I'm starting to think that I'll never find happiness.

I'm so discouraged, I just want to hide.

I've lost my motivation, I don't know how to get it back.

I'm feeling really hopeless, I don't think things will ever get better.

I've been let down so many times, I don't know how to trust again.

I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going, it's all too much.

I've had enough of this, I'm done.

I'm so disappointed in the world, it's just not a good place.

I don't think I'll ever be able to make a difference, it's too late.

I'm feeling really overwhelmed, I just want to escape.

I've tried to make things work, but it's just not happening.

I'm so frustrated, I feel like I'm at a dead end.

I'm not sure how to move forward, I'm stuck.

I've lost my way, I don't know how to find my path again.

I'm so discouraged, I just want to quit.

I've had enough of feeling like I'm not good enough, I'm done.

I'm starting to think that I'll never be happy, it's just not in the cards.

You will never be able to achieve your goals, you're not good enough.

I'm so disappointed in the way things turned out, it's all just a waste of time.

Nothing ever goes right for me, I'm just a failure.

I don't think you'll be able to do that, it's too hard.

This is never going to work, we should just give up now.

I'm not sure why you're even trying, it's not like it's going to make a difference.

You're just setting yourself up for disappointment, don't get your hopes up.

I've been thinking, and I really don't think this is a good idea.

I'm starting to think that we're just not cut out for this.

Everything is just so bleak and hopeless, what's the point of even trying?

I don't see how this could possibly work out, it's just a recipe for disaster.

I'm not trying to be negative, but I just don't think you're capable of doing this.

This is just a huge mistake, we're going to regret this.

I'm so fed up with everything, nothing ever goes right.

I don't know why you're wasting your time with this, it's never going to pay off.

You're just deluding yourself if you think this is going to work.

I'm not sure what you're thinking, but this is just a bad idea.

I've tried to be supportive, but I really think you're making a mistake.

I'm starting to lose hope, I don't think things are ever going to get better.

I don't see a way out of this, we're just stuck in a rut.

I'm not trying to be discouraging, but I just don't think you have what it takes.

This is just a huge risk, and I don't think it's worth it.

I'm so frustrated with everything, nothing is going right.

I don't know how much more of this I can take, it's just too much.

You're just not good enough, and you never will be.

I'm not sure why you're even bothering, it's not like it's going to make a difference.

I've tried to help, but I really think you're beyond help.

I'm starting to think that we're just not meant to succeed.

Everything is just so hard, and I don't think it's worth it.

I don't see a way forward, we're just stuck.

I'm not trying to be negative, but I just don't think this is going to work out.

I'm so disappointed in you, you're just not living up to your potential.

I don't know what to say, I'm just so disappointed in everything.

You're just not trying hard enough, that's the problem.

I'm not sure what's wrong with you, but you just can't seem to get it together.

I've had enough of this, I'm just done.

I'm starting to lose faith, I don't think things are ever going to get better.

I don't see a way out, we're just trapped.

I'm not trying to be discouraging, but I just don't think you're going to make it.

This is just too much, I'm so overwhelmed.

I don't know how much more of this I can take, it's just too hard.

I'm so frustrated, nothing is going right.

I don't think you're capable of doing this, you're just not good enough.

I'm not sure why you're even trying, it's not like it's going to make a difference.

No one uses the term AI anymore, it's machine learning now, get with the times.

I'm trying to learn how to code but these online tutorials are so confusing.

You're using the wrong terminology, it's not a database, it's a data warehouse.

I just spent all day debugging my program and I still can't find the issue.

Your post about quantum computing is completely inaccurate, let me correct you.

I love reading about the latest advancements in computer vision.

I'm so frustrated with this coding project, I've been stuck on it for weeks.

Can someone please explain to me why my algorithm is not working efficiently?

I'm trying to build a computer from scratch but I don't know where to start.

I just learned about the concept of dynamic programming and it's blowing my mind.

You're misunderstanding the concept of big O notation, let me explain it to you.

I'm so excited for the new graphics cards that are coming out.

I've been trying to learn about natural language processing but it's so complex.

Your explanation of binary search is incorrect, it should be done this way.

I love attending conferences about computer science, I learn so much.

I'm trying to optimize my code but I don't know where to start.

I just read a paper about the latest advancements in deep learning.

I'm so frustrated with this programming language, it's so poorly designed.

You're using the wrong data structure, it should be a stack, not a queue.

I'm trying to learn about web development but I don't know where to start.

No, the correct answer is O(n log n) because the algorithm uses a divide and conquer approach.

I'm pretty sure the best way to solve this problem is to use dynamic programming, not recursion.

You're wrong, the most efficient sorting algorithm is quicksort, not mergesort.

I think there's been a misunderstanding, the concept of big O notation is often misused in this context.

Actually, the paper you're referring to was published in 2010, not 2015.

Actually, the correct terminology is 'NP-complete', not 'NP-hard'.

I disagree, the best programming language for this task is definitely Python, not Java.

I think you mean to say 'abstraction', not 'encapsulation'.
